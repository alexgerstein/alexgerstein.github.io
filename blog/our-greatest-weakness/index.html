<p>The three great virtues of a programmer: laziness, impatience, and hubris.</p>

<p>&ndash; Larry Wall, creator of Perl</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a software engineer, you&rsquo;re trained to optimize for efficiency. Code shouldn&rsquo;t take up too much space, and it shouldn&rsquo;t take too long to run. You recognize that every solution makes a trade-off between speed and memory. The actual output of the code itself must find a balance between how quickly it can be released to users and how much technical debt it leaves behind. The length of the code should be efficient in its line count, while still remaining readable to future maintainers.</p>

<p>When efficiency becomes a top concern, everything begins to look like an optimization problem.</p>

<p>Software companies are built to solve for efficiencies. Whether they&rsquo;re inefficiencies in running a business or hailing a cab.</p>

<p>To us techies, the answer to these problems seems so obvious: Build an app!</p>

<p>Just as there&rsquo;s a counter-balance for brevity (readability) or speed efficiency (memory), maybe there&rsquo;s one for the digital revolution: Empathy.</p>

<p>People who are lazy tend to get impatient with others more easily. <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:study"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:study">1</a></sup></p>

<p>But the lazy people must recognize maybe they&rsquo;re not as lazy as they could be. Or maybe they&rsquo;re causing more issues down the line.</p>

<p>Reuse the same class with inheritance, so I don&rsquo;t need to write the same code. FalseLaziness. I didn&rsquo;t know there was another way until I set out with an open mind to learn it. Just copy-paste!</p>

<p>Now when I&rsquo;m pairing with a more junior developer who hasn&rsquo;t run into the pitfalls of inheritance, I want them to learn for themselves why it&rsquo;s not always a good idea.</p>

<p>Pairing with Kelly, duplicated a spec for a similar looking class we&rsquo;d written. He took the time to let me try to edit it and see that maybe it wasn&rsquo;t a good idea before suggesting maybe we just start the file from scratch.</p>

<p>Impatience is just irritation when someone else doesn&rsquo;t do something in the same way you do.</p>

<p>We need to take the time to understand someone else&rsquo;s approach before asserting ours as faster, better.</p>

<p>There are many ways to do &ldquo;lazy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Larry Wall was a linguist. His experience with language taught him that trying to simplify the complex only overcomplicates the situation. He understands the irony in classifying seemingly negative characteristics as virtues. In the talk, he makes the qualification that those characteristics apply only to the philosophy of the language. For the community, he advised to follow the opposites: diligence, patience, and humility.</p>

<p>&ldquo;the more perspectives we can see things from, the easier it will be to choose the perspectives we like.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.perl.com/pub/1998/08/show/onion.html/">https://www.perl.com/pub/1998/08/show/onion.html/</a></p>

<p>When we build software, it&rsquo;s so easy to fall into the trap of believing you&rsquo;ll have a one-size-fits-all solution. But we so easily forget the users not like us. The ones who don&rsquo;t always prefer the lazy way.</p>

<p>With humans, there&rsquo;s no such thing as optimal. There are always edge cases in our viewpoints. When we&rsquo;re always looking for an optimal efficiency, we design for our own idealism for what that viewpoint may be. It&rsquo;s no wonder we have a problem with empathy.</p>

<p>When we optimize for efficiency, empathy suffers.</p>

<pre><code>Laziness acknowledges the relation of the present to the past but
ignores its relation to the future; impatience acknowledges its relation
to the future but ignores its relation to the past; neither the lazy nor the
impatient man, that is, accepts the present instant in its full reality and
so cannot love his neighbour completely
</code></pre>
