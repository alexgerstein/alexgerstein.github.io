As a software engineer, you're trained to look for lazy solutions.

People who are lazy tend to get impatient with others more easily.

Impatience is just irritation when someone else doesn't do something in the same lazy, fast way you do.

We need to take the time to understand someone else's approach before asserting ours as faster, better.

When we build software, it's so easy to fall into the trap of believing you'll have a one-size-fits-all solution. But we so easily forget the users not like us. The ones who don't always prefer the lazy way.

With humans, there's no such thing as optimal. There are always edge cases in our viewpoints. When we're always looking for an optimal efficiency, we design for our own idealism for what that viewpoint may be. It's no wonder we have a problem with empathy.

When we optimize for efficiency, empathy suffers.
