# DARTplan - Starting a side project in college

### Build something people will want
 * keeps you motivated
 * let me try my hand at amateurish marketing
 * feature requests, etc.

### It doesn't need to be perfect
 * Just make progress/one step at a time
 * Make sure you're still learning

### Know when to cut ties
 * When you're no longer learning, move onto something else 
 * You can try to pass it on, but make sure the knew person in charge is learning too
 * Registrar told me everyone does this
