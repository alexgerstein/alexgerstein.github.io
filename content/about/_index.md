Hi! My name is Alex Gerstein. I'm a software engineer, based in San Francisco. I write code in the hopes that others can spend less time at a computer. Currently, that means building better payroll at [Gusto](https://www.gusto.com).

The content of this blog is entirely my own. I started posting here to formalize my learnings and further develop my writing.

When I'm not typing at a screen, I may be watching [foreign films](https://www.taste.io/users/gerstein.alex), playing a round of [golf](https://golfshot.com/profiles/rRgN2) or [reading fiction](https://www.goodreads.com/algerstein).
