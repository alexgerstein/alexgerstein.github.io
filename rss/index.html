After starting with <a href='http://alexgerstein.com/films' >films</a>, programming has become a great way to build projects to share with others.</p>

<p>Here are some of the projects I've been able to share with others:</p>

<h2 id="dartplan">DARTPlan</h2>

<p><img src='http://alexgerstein.com/content/images/2014/Jun/dartplan-screengrab.png'  alt="DARTPlan" />
While looking to learn languages and frameworks that are not covered in my CS courses, I decided to make a <a href='https://www.dartplan.com/'  title="DARTPlan">webapp</a> that allows Dartmouth students to better plan out their majors. Before the app, students had to look up each course they wanted to take on a website and manually check for scheduling changes and conflicts. My Flask webapp does all of this trivial work by scraping the course pages and providing a simple, user-friendly interface to drag and drop courses during terms when they are offered. Over 1,450 students have already signed-up! The code is currently <a href='https://github.com/alexgerstein/dartmouth-major-planner'  title="DARTPlan">open-source</a>.</p>

<h2 id="mapd">mapd</h2>

<p><img src='http://alexgerstein.com/content/images/2014/Jun/mapd.jpg'  alt="mapd" />
This iPhone app allowed the Dartmouth community to post and share photos of events around campus. Two of my peers and I went from knowing nothing about Objective-C or XCode to finalizing this social networking app in only six weeks. I personally worked mainly on the front-end of the project.</p>

<h2 id="svncomet">SVN Comet</h2>

<p>The four-week team project for Software Design and Implementation (COSC 50) required each group to make its own multiplayer physics game, á la Crayon Physics, in C using GTK and the <a href='http://chipmunk-physics.net/'  title="Chipmunk Physics">Chipmunk Physics Library</a>. This was the first project I developed with a team. Everyone stepped up tremendously, but the project management experience I gained from leading the team (two of the three other members were busy during crunch time with their senior theses) was invaluable. Early on in the process, I was tasked with the GUI, but as gaps formed in the work, I stepped up to assist with the client-server interaction and physics simulation.</p>]]></description><link>http://alexgerstein.com/projects/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">20919158-adad-484b-8436-0df860110706</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Alex Gerstein]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jul 2014 07:15:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Films I've Directed]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>My greatest passion aside from <a href='http://alexgerstein.com/projects/'  title="Projects">technology</a> is filmmaking. Making movies is a great way to collaborate with a team and to create something that extends beyond yourself.</p>

<p>Over the years, I have taken numerous courses in film and, in addition to my <a href='http://alexgerstein.com/alexgersteinresume.pdf'  title="Résumé">Computer Science major</a>, am working towards a Film and Media Studies minor. Here are a couple of the student films I've created:</p>

<h3 id="goodvibesducttapestorieswithcindypierce">Good Vibes &amp; Duct Tape: Stories with Cindy Pierce</h3>

<iframe src='http://player.vimeo.com/video/95439024'  width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>For my documentary filmmaking class in Spring 2014, I directed this short about local mother/innkeeper/stand-up comedian, Cindy Pierce. At over 22 minutes, this was the longest film I've worked on by far. Thankfully, I did not work on this alone. Each of the six other students in the class had a hand in the final product. Not to mention the tremendous enthusiasm and kindness that Cindy brought to the film! In addition to the trailer above, you can watch <a href='http://vimeo.com/99738706' >behind-the-scenes</a> footage edited by the cinematographer, Eddie Zapata. If you're interested in seeing the film in its entirety, <a href='mailto:alex@gerste.in' >let me know</a>.</p>

<h3 id="whyijoinedthedartmouth">Why I Joined "The Dartmouth"</h3>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/iG9o9e0cHXs'  frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>While spending my sophomore summer on campus--as sophomores are required to do at Dartmouth--I put together a recruitment video for The Dartmouth, our daily newspaper. This is unofficially the first video of the revamped <em>The Dartmouth</em> Multimedia staff. Since putting together a team of directors and editors, the staff has produced some great work that you can check out on <a href='http://www.youtube.com/user/TheDartmouthVideo' >our YouTube Channel</a>.</p>

<h3 id="snoodles">Snoodles</h3>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/2t1dwh0Lv_E'  frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>The summer before my sophomore year of high school, I traveled on a National Geographic Student Expedition to Iceland. While there, we were tasked with directing a five-minute short about anything we found interesting. This is a character study I made about a sheep named Snoodles who pestered the patrons of the Cowshed Café in Vogafjosi.</p>

<h3 id="occupydigibrain">Occupy Digibrain</h3>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/qtt31eQp4as'  frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>As the culminating project for my freshman writing course (WRIT 5), I directed my friends in a sci-fi film--part <em>1984</em>, part <em>Occupy Wall Street</em>--about the dangers of computer-assisted brains. It sounds tacky. It is...but I had a great time putting it together with them.</p>

<h3 id="thedirectorandme">The Director and Me</h3>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/E0pi2uvddtQ'  frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>  

<p>I created this film as my final assignment for Filmmaking 1 in Fall 2012. We only had one week to write, film and edit, so the production schedule was tight for everyone. To work around this issue, I wrote a story that would only require one actor. The main actor actually has a twin brother, so I wasn't able to convince everyone that only one of them acted in this film.</p>

<p>I wanted to make my final paper for Japanese Cinema (FILM 42) more accessible to those who have not seen the film I analyzed, so instead of simply writing a paper on Yasuzo Masumura's underated gem, <em>Giants and Toys</em> (1958), I made a visual essay to accompany it.</p>]]></description><link>http://alexgerstein.com/films/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">6579716f-a269-4770-8c13-2ebdd496e03c</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Alex Gerstein]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jul 2014 07:13:37 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[About Me]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>I'm currently a Computer Science major entering my senior year at <a href='http://dartmouth.edu/'  title="Education">Dartmouth College</a> in Hanover, NH.

<p>These pursuits can be found in the <a href='https://github.com/alexgerstein'  title="GitHub">open-source projects</a> to which I contribute, the internships I've pursued and the posts on this site.
