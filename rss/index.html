Learning computer science is, for me, the means to this end. Each new thing I learn--inside or outside the classroom--broadens the range of what I can make. There are few things more satisfying than releasing a new product and seeing others make use of it.</p>

<p>Here are some of the awesome projects I've been able to share with others:</p>

While looking to learn languages and frameworks that are not covered in my CS courses, I decided to make a <a href='https://www.dartplan.com/'  title="DARTPlan">webapp</a> that allows Dartmouth students to better plan out their majors. Before the app, students had to look up each course they wanted to take on a website and manually check for scheduling changes and conflicts. My Flask webapp does all of this trivial work by scraping the course pages and providing a simple, user-friendly interface to drag and drop courses during terms when they are offered. Over 1,450 students have already signed-up! The code is currently <a href='https://github.com/alexgerstein/dartmouth-major-planner'  title="DARTPlan">open-source</a>.</p>

This iPhone app allowed the Dartmouth community to post and share photos of events around campus. Two of my peers and I went from knowing nothing about Objective-C or XCode to finalizing this social networking app in only six weeks. I personally worked largely on the front-end of the project. Unfortunately, the app is no longer available on the App Store.</p>

<p>The four-week team project for Software Design and Implementation (COSC 50) required each group to make its own multiplayer physics game, á la Crayon Physics, in C using GTK and the <a href='http://chipmunk-physics.net/'  title="Chipmunk Physics">Chipmunk Physics Library</a>. This was the first project I developed with a team. Everyone stepped up tremendously, but the project management experience I gained from leading the team (two of the three other members were busy during crunch time with their senior theses) was invaluable. Early on in the process, I was tasked with the GUI, but as gaps formed in the work, I stepped up to assist with the client-server interaction and physics simulation. I could not have been happier with our final product.</p>]]></description><link>http://alexgerstein.com/projects/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">20919158-adad-484b-8436-0df860110706</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Alex Gerstein]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jul 2014 07:15:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Films I've Directed]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>My greatest passion aside from <a href='http://alexgerstein.com/projects/'  title="Projects">technology</a> is filmmaking. The interest largely grew from my early fascination with Pixar and all of the technical aspects behind the work they do.</p>

<p>After a few courses in 3D animation, I wanted to learn as much as I could about film in general. I now have taken numerous courses in film and, in addition to my <a href='http://alexgerstein.com/alexgersteinresume.pdf'  title="Résumé">Computer Science major</a>, am working towards a Film and Media Studies minor. Here are a couple of the student films I've created:</p>

<p>While spending my sophomore summer on campus--as sophomores are required (highly encouraged) to do at Dartmouth--I put together a recruitment video for The Dartmouth, our daily newspaper. This is unofficially the first video of the revamped <em>The Dartmouth</em> Multimedia staff. Since putting together a team of directors and editors, we've produced some great work that you can check out on <a href='http://www.youtube.com/user/TheDartmouthVideo' >our YouTube Channel</a>.</p>

<p>I created this film as my final assignment for Filmmaking 1 in Fall 2012. We only had one week to write, film and edit, so the production schedule was tight for everyone. To work around this issue, I wrote a story so that would only require one actor. The main actor actually has a twin brother, so I couldn't convince everyone that only one of them acted in this film.</p>

<p>During the summer leading up to my sophomore year of high school, I was fortunate enough to travel on a National Geographic Student Expedition to Iceland. While there, we were tasked with directing a five-minute short about anything we found interesting. This is a character study I made about a sheep named Snoodles who pestered the patrons of the Cowshed Café in Vogafjosi.</p>

<p>As the culminating project for my freshman writing course (WRIT 5), I directed my friends in a sci-fi film--part <em>1984</em>, part <em>Occupy Wall Street</em>--about the dangers of computer-assisted brains. It sounds tacky. It is...but I had a great time putting it together with them.</p>

<p>I wanted to make my final paper for Japanese Cinema (FILM 42) more accessible to those who have not seen the film, so instead of simply writing a paper on Yasuzo Masumura's underated gem, <em>Giants and Toys</em> (1958), I made a visual essay to accompany it.</p>]]></description><link>http://alexgerstein.com/films/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">6579716f-a269-4770-8c13-2ebdd496e03c</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Alex Gerstein]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jul 2014 07:13:37 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[About Me]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>I'm currently a Computer Science major entering my senior year at <a href='http://dartmouth.edu/'  title="Education">Dartmouth College</a> in Hanover, NH.
